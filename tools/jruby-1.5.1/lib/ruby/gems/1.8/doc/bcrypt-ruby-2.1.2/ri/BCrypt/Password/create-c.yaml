  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Hashes a secret, returning a BCrypt::Password instance. Takes an optional <tt>:cost</tt> option, which is a logarithmic variable which determines how computational expensive the hash is to calculate (a <tt>:cost</tt> of 4 is twice as much work as a <tt>:cost</tt> of 3). The higher the <tt>:cost</tt> the harder it becomes for attackers to try to guess passwords (even if a copy of your database is stolen), but the slower it is to check users' passwords.
